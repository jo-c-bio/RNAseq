Identification of differentially expressed genes in NERP mutants (ate1 ate2 or prt6-1) and wildtype (Col-0),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Using Affymetrix's MAS5.0, PMA calls were scored as present (P)=2 marginal (M)=1 absent (A)=0 for each probe pair set. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Mean PMA scores were calculated from multiple biological replicates. All probe pair sets with a ≥1 PMA score were retained for further analyses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Plastid- and mitochondrial-encoded genes were removed from the Dataset. A total of 17,505 probes were selected after PMA, plastid, and mitochondria filtering",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,RMA-normalized data were used for comparisons between conditions (hypoxia and control) or genotypes (mutants and wildtype) by use of LIMMA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Differentially expressed genes (SLR ≥1 or ≤1 and adj p. <0.01 are presented in the table (n=498),,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Abbreviations used for the comparisons: NS, 2 h non-stress (control conditions also known as ""normoxia""); HS, 2 h hypoxic stress (hypoxia)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of k-means clusters in the NERP dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Genes from each k-means cluster were used for calculating gene ontologyenrichment values using the GOHyperGAll function (Horan et al. 2008),,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"First, all GOs that were significantly enriched in a gene list (Padj<0.05) were recorded",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Second, the overlapping GO categories were reduced to remove nested GO terms with the Simplify variant of the GOHyperGAll function",,,,,,,,,,,,,
